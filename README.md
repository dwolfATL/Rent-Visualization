Using pure D3, I created a choropleth visualization
for Monthly Rent Cost for AT&T leases from 2010 to 2015. 
Please note that the values shown in the chart have been significantly 
adjusted due to the proprietary nature of the information.

The visualization starts with a narrative-driven animation
that cycles through the years. It then transitions to 
reader-driven interaction by allowing the user to select 
the year and get more detailed information in the hover
boxes over each state.

This project was completed as part of my Udacity Data Analyst
Nanodegree.
